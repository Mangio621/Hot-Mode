### The DDJ-200 Pad Controller

*Author: Cole Mangio*

Having purchased the DDJ-200 with rekordbox, I was quite upset that 
hotkeys couldn't be assigned to the pad modes Hot Cue, Beat Loop, Pad FX and Sampler.
So I wrote a controller that switches pad modes for you
based on hotkeys and pad mode button positions assigned in the controller I made.

### Install:

Download the zip via the green code button and drag the Hot-Mode-main file into your desktop.
Open the folder on your desktop and simply run Hot Mode.exe!

### !! ** HOW TO USE ** !!

1. Open rekordbox

2. Now you have to give the controller the exact position of the pad mode buttons in rekordbox. 
To do this, go to the hot mode controller and assign a pad mode button position by clicking
the button that says "X: 0 Y: 0" below a pad mode. Then, right-click the associated pad mode
button in rekordbox across the bottom. Repeat this process to assign all of the other
pad mode button locations

3. Your hotkeys are displayed above the pad mode in the controller. Default are the function keys.
Simply open rekordbox and press the hot key assigned in the controller to switch pad modes.

4. To assign hotkeys, turn the controller off and just press the hotkey button above a pad mode of 
your choice in the controller and simply press any key on your keyboard.

5. To toggle the controller on and off, press the middle button that says 'ON'
