### The DDJ-200 Pad Controller

*Author: Cole Mangio*

Having purchased the DDJ-200 with rekordbox, I was quite upset that 
hotkeys couldn't be assigned to the pad modes Hot Cue, Beat Loop, Pad FX and Sampler.
So I wrote a controller that switches pad modes for you
based on hotkeys and pad mode button positions assigned in the controller I made.

### !! ** NOTE ** !!

Windows might detect that the exe contains a virus because i've used python and pyinstaller.
So i've also included my sourcecode for the app, if you still don't trust me :)
Feel free to read the source code. To run the source code, pip install keyboard and pip install mouse
and run the script by doing python ./Hot Mode.exe. Other wise if you trust me, download the contents,
move the Hot Mode folder inside the zip to desktop and simply run the exe.

### !! ** HOW TO USE ** !!

1. Open rekordbox
2. Now you have to give the controller the exact position of the pad mode buttons in rekordbox. 
To do this, go to the hot mode controller and assign a pad mode button position by clicking
the button that says "X: 0 Y: 0" below a pad mode. Then, right-click the associated pad mode
button in rekordbox across the bottom. Repeat this process to assign all of the other
pad mode button locations
3. Your hotkeys are displayed above the pad mode in the controller. Default are the function keys.
Simply open rekordbox and press the hot key assigned in the controller to switch pad modes.
4. To assign hotkeys, turn the controller off and just press the hotkey button above a pad mode of 
your choice in the controller and simply press any key on your keyboard.
5. To toggle the controller on and off, press the middle button that says 'ON'
